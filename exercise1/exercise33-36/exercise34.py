'''exercise 1
This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.

For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:

    >>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
        Albert Einstein
        Benjamin Franklin
        Ada Lovelace
        >>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
        Benjamin Franklin
        >>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
        Happy coding!
